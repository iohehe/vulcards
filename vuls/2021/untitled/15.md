> 1. userA has an account on server
> 2. userB has an account on server
> 3. userA and userB do a lot of chatting via talk
> 4. At some point userB leaves the server and their account is deleted
> 5. Now a new user comes along that gets assigned the id userB \(or registers it or whatever\)
> 6. If the new userB now opens the chat to userA they will see all the messages exchanged between userA and the old userB

> 1. Create a new apptoken in `https://server/settings/user/security`
> 2. Click the .. of your new apptoken and make it not allowed to access the filesystem
> 3. Log out
> 4. Navigate to `https://server/remote.php/dav` and login with your username + apptoken
> 5. Navigate again to `https://server/settings/user/security`
> 6. You won't be able to access the apptoken data
> 7. Obtain the CSRF token
> 8. Send a PUT request to `https://server/settings/personal/authtokens/ID` chaging the scope
>
> Now the ID you do not know. However even on a decent sized system it is not hard to iterate this as there is no rate limiting or throttling at all. And voila. You have filesystem access.You could also remove other apptokens of the same user \(if you'd want\).
