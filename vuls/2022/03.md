## Week 1

### XSS

I am not sure there are some valuable vulnerabilities in this week .

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1400197" %}

This is a common reflected XSS in the mail.ru, using

```
"><sCrIpT>alert(1)</sCrIpT>

```

But I am weird how they can find this url.



### subdomain token

The questions of subdomain takeover are also a very common vulnerabilities.

This is a bug report about mail.ru, which has  a unclaimed subdomain that can be takeovered from \`tilda.cc\`&#x20;
