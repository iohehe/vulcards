## Week 1

### 1. XSS

I am not sure there are some valuable vulnerabilities in this week .

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1400197" %}

This is a common reflected XSS in the mail.ru, using

```
"><sCrIpT>alert(1)</sCrIpT>

```

But I am weird how they can find this url.



### 2. subdomain token

The questions of subdomain takeover are also a very common vulnerabilities.

This is a bug report about mail.ru, which has  a unclaimed subdomain that can be takeovered from \`tilda.cc\`&#x20;

This is a PHP website written by Laraval, and leaking the APP\_KEY, in the [https://radio.mtn.bj/info\
](https://radio.mtn.bj/info)

### Top3

This is a very interesting open arbitrary URL vul.

When you share your location, the package contains a objectId parameter, you can change it to any URL. And it would be trigget when you click the share place.

### Top4

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1066203" %}

There is no detail, but it must be fun.



\---

### Top5

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1261225" %}

This is a DoS in the nextcloud.  This DoS is targeted by uploading  a image. The PHP GD would be DoS, when people upload lots of such files which will cause the server to allocate too much memory/CPU.&#x20;

(It's basically an "empty" jpeg file with header information that don't match the actual image.)
