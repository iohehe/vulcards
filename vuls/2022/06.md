{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1527405" %}

* While testing **Imgur** I found an unclaimed subdomain which is; ‚Äú8ybhy85kld9zp9xf84x6.imgur.com‚Äù, and I was able to claim it!
* But actually I didn't upload or host a simple file like `mr_baka.html`, because I need to upgrade the account to be able to use this custom domain!
* Anyway, you can verify that I was able to claim this subdomain by visiting [https://8ybhy85kld9zp9xf84x6.imgur.com](https://8ybhy85kld9zp9xf84x6.imgur.com/) and clicking [Manage domain settings here.](https://mrbaka.squarespace.com/config#/settings/domains), which should lead you to my account; [https://mrbaka.squarespace.com"](https://mrbaka.squarespace.com"/) .
