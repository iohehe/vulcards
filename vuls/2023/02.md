> None - XSS - 250

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1398285" %}

The attacker can inject the payload into the shop addition options.

1. go to the user profile
2. click add recommendation, the payload is a link tag: `<a href="data:text/html;charset=utf-7;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiWFNTIik8L3NjcmlwdD4=">`Click Here`</a>`

(It seems the base64 encode can bypass the check)

3. click on HTML tag, the XSS will be triggered.
