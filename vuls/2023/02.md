> Low - SSRF - 150

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/1736390" %}

There is a Blind SSR vulnerability through the Nextcloud \`Mail\` application.

Using response time as a side effect, we can scan the port whether open on the server.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)



Response time < 100ms = port closed/no listening on it. Port > 1000ms response, port open, listening with a service on it. Here I will scan my server locally

It is important here to leave the parameter `imapSslMode` on `none` !(idk why)
